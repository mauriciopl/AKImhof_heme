The execution is in 2 modes 1. default 2. structure

So lets imagine that my sequence is in the file my_fasta.txt:

default (Where WESA execution is done)

python SeqD-HBM_Linux_Win.py my_fasta.txt default

structure (Where WESA execution is skipped)

python SeqD-HBM_Linux_Win.py my_fasta.txt structure
